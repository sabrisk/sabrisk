## Hi there 👋

I'm Brock, a software engineer based in Georgia.

I love building and shipping things that make life easier.

If I have a cool idea, it's getttin' built.

My main tech stack is React, Typescript, Tailwind, NextJS, and Prisma. My favorite tools are VSCode, Figma, and Obsidian.

I'm currently building GiftListPal, a friendly gift list app to help friends and families coordinate gift giving for parties, holidays, or wherever else gifts are given.

#### Fun Facts
- I enjoy a little hand tool woodworking
- I think I like chocolate more than most people
- I'm a sucker for a good romantic comedy anime
- **Hobbies**: anime, gym, building things
